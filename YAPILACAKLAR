 You will change your play functions. Your new class will have two functions named play that
plays the game for a single step. First function does not take a parameter and it plays the
computer and it returns the Cell where it made a change. The second function takes a Cell
position and it plays the user.




 Write a function that returns a score for the user. The score will be higher if the board is better
for the user. It is highest if the user wins and it is zero at the beginning of the game. You may
choose to count the number of connected cells in the correct direction.
 Overload operator== for comparing two Hex games like you did in HW3.


 

You will use all the object oriented techniques that we learned in the class including nullptr,
explicit keywords.
