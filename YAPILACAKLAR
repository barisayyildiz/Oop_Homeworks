play fonksiyonu -> Cell return edicek!!!
explicit -> conversion constructor oluştur!!!
Big3 -> eklenecek!!!


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 You will change your play functions. Your new class will have two functions named play that
plays the game for a single step. First function does not take a parameter and it plays the
computer and it returns the Cell where it made a change. The second function takes a Cell
position and it plays the user.
 

You will use all the object oriented techniques that we learned in the class including nullptr,
explicit keywords.
